## Designing Data Intensive Applications

This section is based on the book published by O'Reilly. [PDF](https://github.com/jeffrey-xiao/papers/blob/master/textbooks/designing-data-intensive-applications.pdf)

This book is a must-read. It gives you a high level understanding of different technology, including the idea behind it, the pros and cons, and the problem it is trying to solve. A great book for practitioners who want to learn all the essential concepts quickly.

### Of particular importance:
* Reliable, scalable, and maintainable applications (Dev, SRE)
* Data models and query language -> Relational model vs document model (Dev, SRE)
* Replication (SRE) 
* Partitioning (Dev, SRE)
* Transactions (Dev, SRE)
* The trouble with distributed systems (SRE)
* Batch processing (Dev, SRE)
* Stream processing (Dev, SRE)
