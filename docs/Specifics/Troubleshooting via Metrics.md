# Troubleshooting via Metrics

## Looking at Graphs

Wants to check for deployment activity
Wants to check for cyclical pattern (week over week etc)
Wants to check for recent changes to threshold
Wants to check for magnitude of difference below threshold
Asks NOC for nothing (while investigating) OR
Asks NOC to look for other reg-related alerts/flows/metrics
Makes a sensible guess for the cause of the problem
Makes a second sensible guess (some examples: ABI, seasonality, one colo failure)
Questions the time it took NOC to escalate or mentions it as a followup item

## Initial Troubleshooting

Reviews all presented data and asks appropriate questions about it
Suggests a correlation between deployment and drop in regs from graph
Suggests problem may be due to deployment from informed
Wants to check error logs on the reg service
Wants to check some other log (that makes some degree of sense to check)

## Initial Resolution

Takes a logical action to resolve the issue
Second action is also logical based on 1st failing
Stays calm and doesn’t argue when told their solution didn’t work

## Secondary Resolution

Last action also meaningful
Suggests escalation to engineering
Suggests escalation to management
Has articulable thing for escalated person to do
Articulable thing makes sense given the problem
Second articulable thing for escalated person, that also makes sense
